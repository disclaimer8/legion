## ‚ú® About

Legion, a fork of SECFORCE's Sparta, is an open source, easy-to-use, super-extensible, and semi-automated network
penetration testing framework that aids in discovery, reconnaissance, and exploitation of information systems.
[Legion](https://govanguard.com/legion) is developed and maintained by [GoVanguard](https://govanguard.com). More
information about Legion, including the [roadmap](https://govanguard.com/legion), can be found on its project page
at [https://GoVanguard.com/legion](https://govanguard.com/legion).

If you are interested in contributing to Legion, join
our [Legion Keybase Team](https://keybase.io/team/govanguard.dev.legion).

## üçø Features

* Automatic recon and scanning with NMAP, whataweb, nikto, Vulners, Hydra, SMBenum, dirbuster, sslyzer, webslayer and
  more (with almost 100 auto-scheduled scripts).
* Easy to use graphical interface with rich context menus and panels that allow pentesters to quickly find and exploit
  attack vectors on hosts.
* Modular functionality allows users to easily customize Legion and automatically call their own scripts/tools.
* Highly customizable stage scanning for ninja-like IPS evasion.
* Automatic detection of CPEs (Common Platform Enumeration) and CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).
* Ties CVEs to Exploits as detailed in Exploit-Database.
* Realtime auto-saving of project results and tasks.

### Notable changes from Sparta

* Refactored from Python 2.7 to Python 3.6 and the elimination of deprecated and unmaintained libraries.
* Upgraded to PyQT5, increased responsiveness, less buggy, more intuitive GUI that includes features like:
    * Task completion estimates
    * 1-Click scan lists of ips, hostnames and CIDR subnets
    * Ability to purge results, rescan hosts and delete hosts
    * Granular NMAP scanning options
* Support for hostname resolution and scanning of vhosts/sni hosts.
* Revise process queuing and execution routines for increased app reliability and performance.
* Simplification of installation with dependency resolution and installation routines.
* Realtime project auto-saving so in the event some goes wrong, you will not lose any progress!
* Docker container deployment option.
* Supported by a highly active development team.

## üåâ Supported Distributions

### Docker runIt script support

RunIt script (`docker/runIt.sh`) supports:

- Ubuntu 18
- Fedora 30
- ParrotOS
- Kali Linux

It is possible to run the docker image on any Linux distribution, however, different distributions have different hoops
to jump through to get a docker app to be able to connect to the X server. Everyone is welcome to try to figure those
hoops out and create a PR for runIt.

### Traditional installation support

We can only promise correct operation on **Ubuntu 18** using the traditional installation at this time. While it should
work on ParrotOS, Kali, and others, until we have Legion packaged and placed into the repos for each of these distros,
it is musical chairs in regard to platform updates changing and breaking dependencies.

## üíª Installation

Two installation methods available:

- [Docker method](#traditional-installation-method)
- [Traditional installation method](#traditional-installation-method)

It is **preferable** to use the Docker method over a traditional installation. This is because of all the dependency
requirements and the complications that occur in environments which differ from a clean, non-default installation.

> NOTE: Docker versions of Legion are *unlikely* to work when run as root or under a root X!

### Docker method

Docker method includes support for various environments, choose the one that works for you.

- [Linux with local X11](#linux-with-local-x11)
- [Linux with remote X11](#linux-with-remote-x11)
- [Windows under WSL](#windows-under-wsl-using-xming-and-docker-desktop)
- [‚ö†Ô∏è Windows without WSL](#windows-using-xming-and-docker-desktop-without-wsl)
- [‚ö†Ô∏è OSX using XQuartz](#osx-using-xquartz)

#### Linux with local X11

Assumes **Docker** and **X11** are installed and set up (including running Docker commands as a non-root user).

It is critical to follow all the instructions for running as a non-root user. Skipping any of them will result in
complications getting Docker to communicate with the X server.

See detailed instructions to set up Docker [here](#configuring-docker) and enable running containers as non-root users
and granting Docker group SSH rights [here](#setup-docker-to-allow-non-root-users).

Within Terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoVanguard/legion.git
cd legion/docker
chmod +x runIt.sh
./runIt.sh
```

#### Linux with remote X11

Assumes **Docker** and **X11** are installed and set up.

Replace `X.X.X.X` with the IP address of the remote running X11.

Within Terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoVanguard/legion.git
cd legion/docker
chmod +x runIt.sh
./runIt.sh X.X.X.X
```

#### Windows under WSL using Xming and Docker Desktop

Assumes:

- Xming is installed in Windows.
- Docker Desktop is installed in Windows
- Docker Desktop is running in Linux containers mode
- Docker Desktop is connected to WSL.

See detailed Docker instructions [here](#setup-hyper-v-docker-desktop-xming-and-wsl)

Replace `X.X.X.X` with the IP address with which Xming has registered itself. Right click Xming in system tray -> View
log and see IP next to "XdmcpRegisterConnection: newAddress"

Within Terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoVanguard/legion.git
cd legion/docker
sudo chmod +x runIt.sh
sudo ./runIt.sh X.X.X.X
```

#### Windows using Xming and Docker Desktop without WSL

Why? Don't do this. :)

#### OSX using XQuartz

Not yet in `runIt.sh` script. Possible to set up using `socat`.
See [instructions here](https://kartoza.com/en/blog/how-to-run-a-linux-gui-application-on-osx-using-docker/)

#### Configuring Docker

#### Setting up Docker on Linux

To install Docker components typically needed and add set up the environment for Docker, under a term, run:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y docker.io python3-pip -y
sudo groupadd docker
pip install --user docker-compose
```

#### Setup Docker to allow non-root users

To enable non-root users to run Docker commands, under a term, run:

```shell
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock
sudo xhost +local:docker
```

#### Setup Hyper-V, Docker Desktop, Xming and WSL

The order is important for port reservation reasons. If you have WSL, HyperV, or Docker Desktop installed then please
uninstall those features before proceeding.

- Cortana / Search -> cmd -> Right click -> Run as Administrator
- To reserve the Docker port, under CMD, run:
  ```shell
  netsh int ipv4 add excludedportrange protocol=tcp startport=2375 numberofports=1
  ```
    - This will likely fail if you have Hyper-V already enabled or Docker Desktop installed
- To install Hyper-V, under CMD, run:
  ```shell
  dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature:Microsoft-Hyper-V /All
  ```
- Reboot
- Cortana / Search -> cmd -> Right click -> Run as Administrator
- To install WSL, under CMD, run:
  ```shell
  dism.exe /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux
  ```
- Reboot
- Download from <https://hub.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows> (Free account required)
- Run installer
- Optionally input your Docker Hub login
- Right click Docker Desktop in system tray -> Switch to Linux containers
    - If it says Switch to Windows containers then skip this step, it's already using Linux containers
- Right click Docker Desktop in system tray -> Settings
- General -> Expose on localhost without TLS
- Download <https://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/files/Xming/6.9.0.31/Xming-6-9-0-31-setup.exe/download>
- Run installer and select multi window mode
- Open Microsoft Store
- Install Kali, Ubuntu or one of the other WSL Linux Distributions
- Open the distribution, let it bootstrap and fill in the user creation details
- To install Docker components typically needed and add set up the environment for Docker redirection, under the WSL
  window, run:
  ```shell
  curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -
  sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) stable"
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install -y docker-ce python-pip -y
  sudo apt autoremove
  sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
  pip install --user docker-compose
  echo "export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375" >> ~/.bashrc && source ~/.bashrc
  ```
- Test Docker is reachable with:
  ```shell
  docker images
  ```

### Traditional installation method

> Please use the Docker image where possible! It's becoming very difficult to support all the various platforms and
> their own quirks.

Assumes Ubuntu, Kali or Parrot Linux is being used with **Python 3.6** installed.

Within Terminal:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/GoVanguard/legion.git
cd legion
sudo chmod +x startLegion.sh
sudo ./startLegion.sh
```

## üèó Development

### Executing test cases

To run all test cases, execute the following in root directory:

```shell
python -m unittest
```
